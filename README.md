# P1_EE333
P1 builds an OO model of part of a design project tool to assist in collecting and using some info needed in a design project.

In P1 we will build an object-oriented model of part of a design project tool to assist in collecting and using
some of the information needed in a design project. We will practice this design project as part of P4 and P5
but for now, we are modeling the information associated with the process and looking at some of the
processes against this information. Module 11 has a subsection on Design and Module 15 has a subsection
on Project planning that guides our modeling. We will start with four objects: constraint, goal, risk, and
project.
